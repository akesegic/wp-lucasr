What is it?
===========

WordPress theme used in my personal blog at http://lucasr.org

Features
========

* Minimalist blog design

Implementation notes
====================

For an overview of the making of this theme, have a look at http://lucasr.org/?p=3419

Feel free to use this theme on your own blog but keep in mind that it's using my
personal [TypeKit](http://typekit.com) URL which will only work on main domain.
You'll have to either use your own TypeKit URL or replace the fonts used in the
theme.
